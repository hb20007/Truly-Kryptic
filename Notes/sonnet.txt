Better than Shakespeare?
There are no hidden messages in the sonnet.

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me prov'd,
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.

Do not let me to the wedding of brains
Confess all hindrances. Real love sure does
Not change when it finds occasion to change,
Or bow with the taker to take away.
Oh no! It is a never-ending sign
That faces storms and yet remains composed;
It is Polaris for every lost ship,
Whose worth's arcane, though not her altitude.
Affection is time-immune, though beauty fades
And is reaped against your will before you know;
The heart remains intact through days and years,
And never falters till the end arrives.
If this be false and you can show the proof,
I don't exist and love is but a spoof.
